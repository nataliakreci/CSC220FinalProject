To run the flask project, you need to have Flask installed.

Look at http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/
1) install Flask using your terminal:
  $ pip install Flask
2) install a virtual environment as well (I am not using it though):
  $ sudo pip install virtualenv

3)then cd your directory inside the flask_app folder and run the app
  $ export FLASK_APP=clickclacktype.py
  $ flask run
4) enter http://127.0.0.1:5000/ into your browser
5) and play!
